# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code

Welcome to my **Advent of Code** repository! Every year, participants solve a series of coding challenges that start on December 1st. Here's a bit more about the event:

The puzzles increase in difficulty each day, and I will attempt to solve them using **Python**.

## ðŸ§© What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is a fun and challenging coding event that consists of 25 daily puzzles, released from **December 1st to December 25th**. The puzzles cover a wide range of topics, and the solutions often require creative problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.
